# Task Tracker Taqaddum (ØªÙ‚Ø¯Ù‘Ù…) (React + Supabase)

The first version is complete. The app is totally functional. This was not meant to be a "Just for show" type of project. I don't even like Javascript. But our likings mean nothing when our deed or work is faulty. This is a acknowdedgement that, We are a not good humans. And it's not okay to be okay with this version. We gotta change. Be the best possible version of ourselves. And it is not even a good deed. It is a basic responsibility.
